fitting a linear regression on the height and the bolting time of the lettuce phenotypes to see if there can be a linear regression to be established. fitting a linear regression on the height and the bolting time of the lettuce phenotypes to see the linear regression of the height and the bolting time. I coded this both in python and R and used the R variations to optimize the python ones such as intercept. 
```

                              var1= "Height (cm)", 
                                       var2="Bolting time (days)")
